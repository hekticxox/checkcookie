## ⚠️ Important Beta Notes

### 🔒 Security & Legal
- **FOR AUTHORIZED TESTING ONLY** - Use only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Educational/Research Purpose** - Designed for security research and penetration testing
- **No Malicious Use** - This tool is for defensive security and authorized assessment

### 🧪 Beta Considerations
- This is a beta release - test thoroughly before production use
- Some domains may have enhanced anti-automation detection
- PayPal and financial institutions have sophisticated blocking systems
- Fresh browser validation prevents cross-contamination but uses more resources

### 📈 Performance Expectations
- High success rates on business/marketing domains (80-95%)
- Moderate success on social media platforms (60-80%)
- Lower success on financial institutions due to advanced security (varies)
- Manual verification recommended for critical validation

## 🔄 Upgrade Path from v2.x

If upgrading from previous versions:

1. **Backup existing data** - Save any important cookie files or results
2. **Update dependencies** - Run `npm install` after pulling changes  
3. **Review new configuration** - Check `config.json` for new settings
4. **Test new modes** - Start with Intelligence Mode to understand capabilities
5. **Use fresh validation** - Try the new session_validator.js for manual verification

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

- Some financial institutions (PayPal, banks) have sophisticated anti-automation
- Large cookie files may require processing time for intelligence analysis
- Fresh browser mode uses more system resources but provides better isolation
- Manual verification requires human interaction for final confirmation

## 🚀 What's Next

The v3.0.0 final release will include:
- Performance optimizations based on beta feedback
- Additional prepared domains
- Enhanced anti-detection capabilities
- Automated report generation
- Integration with security testing frameworks
